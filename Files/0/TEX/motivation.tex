\maketitle
We assert that the computational power of GIS can be made accessible to a wider range of
people.
In particular, people of younger age or with less \emph{formal} education than seem to populate the current
roster of ``GIS professionals.''

GIS has inherent \emph{complexity}.
However, aspects of GIS are unnecessarily \emph{complicated}.

In particular, some popular GIS systems exhibit unnecessary complexity in at least two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the application of floating point number systems
\item the obfuscation of a fundamental building block of geometry: the line.
\end{enumerate}
We also assert that precision matters.
It is of little use to communicate a location without also communicating the precision with which that location is known.
